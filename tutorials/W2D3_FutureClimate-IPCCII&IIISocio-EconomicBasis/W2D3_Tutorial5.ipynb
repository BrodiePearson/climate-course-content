    "- You will explore the inner workings of the DICE model, starting with the foundational principles of economics: *utility* and *welfare* functions. You will also learn how these functions aggregate and weight the satisfaction derived from consumption across different societal groups. You will also learn how these functions incorporate uncertain future utility into decision-making through *discount rates*. Valuing future states of the world allows the DICE model to place a value on its projections of future scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the tutorial you will learn about damage functions, which combine climatological and economic knowledge to estimate how climate changes will affect economic productivity and the resultant well-being of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will diagnose optimal planning within the DICE model, determining the best strategies for savings and emissions reduction rates (where _best_ is with respect to a chosen utility and welfare function). \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall objective of this tutorial is to provide a technical understanding of how parameters related to the distribution of value in society impact the optimal climate policy within a relatively simple IAM."

    "# Section 1: Background on IAM Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "The last tutorial gave us a glimpse of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), a class of models economists use to inform policy decisions. Recall that IAMs couple a climate model to an economic model, allowing us to evaluate the two-way coupling between economic productivity and climate change severity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a brief description of IAMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- IAMs resolve the spatially, in contrast, the toy model En-ROADs for example, which we applied in Tutorial 1 to 3, aggregates all variables and is non-spatial.\n",
    "- Like En-ROADS, the world models used in IAMs usually have *exogeneous* (externally set) times series for variables, in addition to fixed world system parameters. These exogenous variables are assumed to be under our society's control (e.g. mitigation). \n",
    "- IAMs come equipped with an objective function (a formula that calculates the quantity to be optimized). This function returns the value of a projected future obtained from running the world model under a given climate policy. This value is defined by the time series of these exogenous variables. In this sense, the objective function is what defines \"good\" in \"good climate policy\". \n",
    "- The computation in an IAM is then an optimization of this objective as a function of the time series of these exogenous variables over some fixed time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "In En-ROADS, there are exogenous parameters, in particular:\n",
    "    - **$\\mu(t)$**: time-dependent mitigation rate (i.e. emissions reduction), which limits warming-caused damages\n",
    "    - **$S(t)$**: savings rate, which drives capital investment \n",
    "\n",
    "Most IAMs are based on *Neo-classical economics* (also referred to as \"establishment economics\"). This is an approach to economics that makes particular assumptions. For example, it is assumed that production, consumption, and valuation of goods and services are driven solely by the supply and demand model. To understand this approach and how it is used, it is important to begin with a brief overview of some fundamental concepts. One such concept is **utility** (i.e. economic value), which is not only central to economics but also to decision theory as a whole, which is a research field that mathematically formalizes the activity of *planning* (planning here means selecting strategies based on how they are expected to play out given a model that takes those strategies and projects forward into the future)."

    "The [Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE)](https://www3.nd.edu/~nmark/Climate/DICE-simplified_2019.pdf) was the first prominent Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), a class of models economists use to inform policy decisions. Recall that IAMs couple a climate model to an economic model, allowing us to evaluate the two-way coupling between economic productivity and climate change severity. DICE is too idealized to be predictive, like `world3`, but DICE is still useful as a sandbox for exploring climate policy ideas, which is how we will use it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a brief description of IAMs and the DICE model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DICE is a fully aggregated (i.e., non-spatial) model, but otherwise contains the essence of many key components of more complex IAMs. \n",
    "- Unlike `world3`, which we encountered in Tutorial 1, the world models used in IAMs usually have *exogeneous* (externally set) times series for variables, in addition to fixed world system parameters. These exogeneous variables are assumed to be under our society's control (e.g. mitigation). \n",
    "- IAMs come equipped with an objective function (a formula that calculates the quantity to be optimized). This function returns the value of a projected future obtained from running the world model under a given climate policy. This value is defined by time series of these exogeneous variables. In this sense, the objective function is what defines \"good\" in \"good climate policy\". \n",
    "- The computation in an IAM is then an optimization of this objective as a function of the time series of these exogeneous variables over some fixed time window. In DICE, there are two exogeneous parameters:\n",
    "    - **$\\mu(t)$**: time-dependent mitigation rate (i.e. emissions reduction), which limits warming-caused damages\n",
    "    - **$S(t)$**: savings rate, which drives capital investment \n",
    "- The choices for the standard values of the parameters used in the DICE models have been critisized, and updated versions have been analyzed and proposed ([Hansel et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0833-x);[Barrage & Nordhaus 2023](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31112)). Here, we look at the standard DICE2016 version of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "All DICE models (and most IAMs) are based on *Neo-classical economics* (also referred to as \"establishment economics\"). This is an approach to economics that makes particular assumptions. For example, it is assumed that production, consumption, and valuation of goods and services are driven solely by the supply and demand model. To understand this approach and how it is used in the DICE model, it is important to begin with a brief overview of some fundamental concepts. One such concept is **utility** (i.e. economic value), which is not only central to economics but also to decision theory as a whole, which is a research field that mathematically formalizes the activity of *planning* (planning here means selecting strategies based on how they are expected to play out given a model that takes those strategies and projects forward into the future)."

    "1. Pick an assumption that is made about the relationship between temperature and economic damage in arriving at a conventional damage function (e.g. that it is: _deterministic_, _continuous_, _constant in time_, _functional_ (instead of dynamical), ...) and explain why you think that assumption might be unrealistic for a specific sector of the economy or a specific region of the planet.\n",
    "2. Can you think of a specific way that temperature variation might cause variation in GDP that could have been significant in structuring the historical and/or geographical covariation of the two variables? How about a causal relationship that will not have been significant in historical or geographic variation up to now, but is likely to be significant as temperatures continue to rise and we experience more extreme climates?

    "\n",
    "We've now explored both the utility function and damage function components of IAMs.  Before we move on to actually running the DICE model, let's summarize what we've learned so far about IAMs, specifically regarding the economy and climate models:\n",
    "\n",
    "The economy model in most IAMs is a capital accumulation model. \n",
    "- Capital ($K$) combines with a laboring population and technology to generate productivity ($Y$) that is hindered by climate damage. \n",
    "- A savings rate, $S$, drives capital accumulation, while the rest is consumed. Welfare is determined by consumption.\n",
    "- Climate action is formulated by a mitigation rate, $\\mu$, which along with the savings rate, $S$, are the two exogeneous control parameters in the model and are used to maximize welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "The climate model in DICE interacts with the economy model via the following equation: \n",
    "$$E_\\mathrm{ind}=(1-\\mu)\\sigma Y,$$ \n",
    "- Productivity ($Y$) generates industrial emissions ($E_\\mathrm{ind}$), where the $1-\\mu$ factor accounts for a reduction of the carbon intensity of production, $\\sigma$, via supply-side mitigation measures (e.g. increased efficiency). \n",
    "- The productivity $Y$ rather than output production ($Q$) is used here because damages aren't included. \n",
    "- Damages aren't included because the emissions produced in the process of capital production occur before climate change has a chance to inflict damage on the produced output. \n",
    "- These industrial emissions combine with natural emissions to drive the temperature changes appearing in the damage function, closing the economy-climate loop. "

    "## Section 2.2: Optimal Planning\n",
    "The goal of the model is to maximize the overall value of a projected future, $V$, within the bounds of mitigation rate, $\\mu$, and savings rate, $S$, time courses (while considering constraints on $\\mu$ and $S$). This approach is known as **optimal planning**. But why does this \"sweet spot\" in which overall value is maximized exist? Increasing savings boosts investment and productivity, but higher production leads to higher emissions, resulting in increased temperature and damages that reduce production. Mitigation costs counterbalance this effect, creating a trade-off. As a result, there typically exists a meaningful joint time series of $\\mu_t$ and $S_t$ that maximizes $V$. Due to the discount factor $\\gamma$, $V$ depends on the future consumption sequence (non-invested production) within a few multiples of the time horizon, approximately $1/(1-\\gamma)$ time steps into the future."

Change* (2020)](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/105699/1/Climate_economics_support_for_the_UN_climate_targets_2.pdf)). These effects are not negligible, but are absent from current IAMs used by the IPCC."

    "The value definition includes exponential temporal discounting (i.e. devaluation of utilities over time) at a rate of r = 1.5% per year so that utility obtained $t$ years into the future is scaled down by $1/(1+r)^t$. What if we set this rate lower so that we don't down scale as quickly (i.e. utilities have more value for longer) and incorporate more in the value definition of what happens in the future when we make decisions?"
