    "During the first week of the course, you learned about types of climate data from measurements, proxies, and models, and computational tools for assessing past, present, and future climate variability recorded by this data. During day one of this week (W2D1), you began to explore climate model data from Earth System Models (ESMs) simulations conducted for the recent Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that are presented in the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/)). However, the dominant source of uncertainty in those projections arises from how human society responds: e.g. how our emissions reduction and renewable energy technologies develop, how coherent our global politics are, how our consumption grows, etc. For these reasons, in addition to understanding the physical basis of the climate variations projected by these models, it's also important to assess the current and future socioeconomic impact of climate change and what aspects of human activity are driving emissions. This day's tutorials focus on the socioeconomic projections regarding the future of climate change and are centered around the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) framework used by the IPCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first tutorial, you will see how society can be represented by interrelated socio-economic variables and their projections for the future. In the bulk of the tutorial, you will use the `En-ROADS` toy model to get some intuition about what 'control knobs' of society and economy can be modeled and how they can affect emission scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Get familiar with the interface of the world model named En-ROADS\n",
    "- Explore the impact of different growth variables on the temperature increase by 2100 projected from the En-ROADS model.\n",
    "- Understand why it is necessary to implement various actions against climate change, not a single one.\n",
    "- Explore the assumptions and limitations of this model\n",

We discussed in the slides how the population is inducing a labor force that produces, and hence creates fossil fuel emissions which increase the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration and subsequently impact temperature, land use, industry, and GDP. This climate change then creates damage to the economy, which the model simulates by translating the temperature rise back into a *damage function*, a dropping [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) (GDP) for increasing temperatures.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Kaya Graphs depict the drivers of growth in carbon dioxide emissions from energy, which reflects about two thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions. The other third of emissions are from land use changes and other gases, such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The corresponding equation, the so called [***Kaya identity***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_identity) below was developed by Yoichi Kaya:\n",

    "This helps to measure and model the emissions if we assume that the factors are independent from each other which in reality is not the case. Each factor in this model is important and extreme reductions in one can offset increases in the others. On the other hand, Emissions $F$ increase over time when the Energy Intensity of GDP $\\left[\\frac{E}{G}\\right] $ and the Carbon Intensity of Energy both do not offset the currently rising GDP ($G$), which is by definition necessary for a growth-based economy.\n",

    "The Global Population ($P$) of 8 billion people is growing and growth is anticipated to be 11 billion by the end of the century, according to UN projections. The rate of growth is slowing over time as people have smaller families.\n",

    "GDP ($G$) per Capita ($P$) is growing steadily per year, and we assume it will continue, mostly as people in rapidly developing countries such as China, India, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia attain higher standards of living.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy Intensity ($E$) of GDP is decreasing over time, due to the world economy becoming more efficient, or using less energy per unit of economic output. Technologies are improving - for example, more efficient cars, buildings, and machines—and economies are shifting from manufacturing to services. The product of global population, GDP per capita, and the energy intensity of GDP is the total amount of energy used by the global economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon Intensity of Final Energy, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by energy use, is expected to slightly decline over time. Overall, this downward trend in carbon intensity is attributed to the gradual shifting away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon energy sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Energy is the result of all four factors multiplied together, and you can see that in the Baseline Scenario emissions are growing. As the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere correlates with temperature, an increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to an increase in global temperatures.\n",

    "Consider a bounded system undergoing only positive feedback leading to exponential growth. The characteristic duration of growth until the system state reaches the system boundary is only weakly sensitive to the size of the boundary. For example, in the context of exponential resource-driven economic growth on Earth, reaching the boundary means exhausting its accessible physical resources. Ten times more or less of the starting amount of accessible resources only changes the time at which those resources are exhausted by a factor of 2 up or down, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Physics demands that behind the exponential extraction of resources is an exponential use of an energy resource. In recent times on Earth, this has been fossil fuels, which are non-renewable. Legitimate concerns of peak oil in the late 1990s were quelled by the Shale revolution in the United States and other technological advances in oil and gas exploration and exploitation. These have increased (by a factor between 2 and 4) the total amount of known reserves that can be profitably exploited. While this increase is significant on an linear scale, it is negligible on an exponential scale. Looking forward, the largest estimates for how much larger accessible oil and gas reserves will be are within an order of magnitude of current reserves. Presuming resource-driven growth economics continues, whatever accessible oil and gass is left will then be exhausted within a short period of time (e.g. within a century). \n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential growth in a bounded system will often slow as it reaches the boundary because of boundary-sized feedback effects. In our case, demand growth for fossil fuels is starting to slow with the development of renewable energy sources. There still substantial uncertainty about how these feedbacks will play out. Some questions to consider: \n",
    "- whether the transition to renewable energy sources can happen before we exhaust the associated non-renewable resources. \n",
    "- Once transitioned, whether the non-renewable resource use (e.g. of rare-earth metals) needed to sustain the renewable energy sector is sustainable in a growth-based economics\n",
    "- Once transitioned, whether this renewable energy resource might not slow, but instead accelerate the extraction of all non-renewable resources (see [Jevon's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)). \n",

    "\n",
    "You might have recognized that a high ***carbon price*** by default has a strong impact on the temperature increase within the En-ROADS model as it both reduces the carbon intensity of the energy supply and reduces the energy demand. However, the carbon price itself could be introduced now or in 50 years and at different amounts, depending on for example the social cost of such a policy, which makes energy supply more expensive depending on its emissions. Energy producers could pass additional costs to their customers, so policy could be designed to minimize the impacts on the poorest, e.g. by introducing a [Carbon fee and dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend). \n",

    "3. The earlier the carbon price starts to phase in the more effective it is regarding the temperature increase. However, the earlier the larger the disturbance of the market price of electricity, emphasized by a strong increase in the price at first and a strong drop in the price after the first few years. This might lead to economic disruptions as energy supply becomes very expensive, therefore low-income households, which usually spend large parts of their income on energy, would need compensation like a 'carbon dividend' to avoid precariat. In summary, actions and their temporal implementation always need to be evaluated in various aspects to be a successful and societal least disruptive action against climate change. \n",
