    "\n",
    "The first two terms we will analyze define the radiative component of the surface energy budget: shortwave and longwave radiation. For each of these terms, there is an upwelling and downwelling component. This is because, for example, some of the downwelling shortwave radiation is reflected back upwards due to the surface albedo. Similarly, some upwelling longwave radiation from Earth is absorbed by the atmosphere and re-emitted back towards the surface. The net radiative flux is given as \n",

    "where the arrows indicate up(down)welling and the $S$ and $L$ are shortwave and longwave. Note that in keeping with the rest of the variables we will look at, the net radiation is defined so that a positive value refers to an upward flux of energy from the ocean or land to the atmosphere. That is, positive indicates heat transport upwards and away from the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be looking at latent and sensible heat. **[Sensible heat](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Sensible_heat)** is the heat transferred due to a temperature difference between touching materials, for example between the air and the land or ocean surface. In this case, if the surface air is warmer than the land/ocean then heat is transferred from the air to the land/ocean (which is a downward or negative sensible heat flux), with an opposite-direction transfer if the air was colder than the land/ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Latent heat](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Latent_heat)** is due to evaporation and condensation of water, as these phase changes absorb and release heat respectively. Here 'latent' means hidden, in that the energy is stored in molecules and there is no temperature change sensed through a thermometer even though a heat transfer takes place.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are not the only terms that comprise the surface energy budget (i.e. geothermal heating, latent heat of fusion for melting ice or snow, biological processes) these are typically the dominant terms that set the global patterns.\n",

The differences in the sensible heat flux seen here are largely caused by the different properties of the three main surface types: land, ocean, and ice. Land typically warms fast when exposed to insolation, the ocean has a much higher heat capacity so does not warm as much as land in response to insolation, and ice typically remains near zero degrees Celsius or colder. This means that land is often warmer than the surface air (strong positive sensible heat flux), the ocean and surface air often have a similar temperature (weak flux), and ice is often much cooler than surface air (strong negative flux)\n",
